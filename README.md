Useful little python scripts for sequence analysis are stored here, probably never to be used again or rewritten before I remember this repository exists

unalign.py - turns aligned sequences into the original sequences. (removes gaps)
reciprocal_blast.py - perfroms reciprocal blasts on an existing gene family for all genes on all databases in a directory, printing whether recipricocity was fullfilled in all cases
